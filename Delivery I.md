PinGoods is a local goods platform dedicated to easily connecting vendors with their customers.

## 1. Purpose

There was once a potato lover who wanted to buy fresh potatoes straight from the farm (because Maxima potatoes are not so tasty). Unfortunately, he didn‘t know anyone who could sell them to him. He looked for them on Facebook, but couldn‘t find a single person. He searched the entire internet but was not able to find a place to contact a potato grower. We could make a new Facebook (but with superior search algorithms of course), but we're too cool for that. Besides, we have an even better idea. On the other side, it‘s not all sunshine and rainbows either. Potato sellers also have a hard time finding someone to buy from them (not because they can‘t navigate Facebook, but because there is no good platform for such things). And that‘s where we come in. We will create a platform that will easily connect not only potato lovers with their sellers, but also various vendors to their customers, and they will all live in great prosperity.

## 2. High-Overview

The aim of the system is to ensure that goods from the villages of all Lithuanian regions can display their purchase location on the map, and when the customer selects the result in the search bar, he gets teleported to the seller's location. What does this really mean? Obviously, we are not making a breakthrough in human evolution (not yet anyway), but rather we are offering the sellers a possibility to advertise their goods, and for the buyers to be informed of desirable existing goods, conveniently pinned on the map. The system will provide the best environment for small businesses to showcase their high-quality products and services. Product prices will be clearly stated including Value-added tax (PVM). Customers will also be able to take advantage of our intuitive sorting system, thanks to a great variety of colours as if van Gogh drew it.
