   ### GitHub formatting

   GitHub formatting [symtaxes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) should be known for formatting your issue description and commits.

   ### Issues

   Issues are created for setting tasks and reporting bugs. All the Issues title must be as follows: "[**TEAMNAME**-**ISSUEID**] **ISSUENAME**", where **TEAMNAME** is the shortcut of the team that must handle this Issue, **ISSUEID** is a unique identification number for each team's Issue.

  ### Gitflow Workflow

   This [article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) contains the git-flow model that should be followed when creating, merging, and deleting branches. For naming branches, please refer to the git branch naming [convention](https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/). **Important!: don't use the tracker ID in the branch name as it's provided in the article. We're not going to use it.**

  ### Coding conventions

  Each developer has his style of coding, and to prevent misundestandings, for each programming language Google Style Guide should be followed.
