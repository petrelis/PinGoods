## Overview of the whole system

This section provides a detailed overview of the internal and external parts of the system, how the components work together, their interactions, and plans. This explanation will help new developers to easily integrate into our project. We must acknowledge developers and not be confused about how to implement this or that functionality.

### 1. External entities

We dedicate to provide an opportunity for our Customers to search and find fresh farm products. We desire to provide an opportunity for our Vendors to increase the selling of their products and connecting with many Customers all around Lithuania. Desiring providing a fair, user-friendly project experience to our users, it needs many functionalities to be implemented. One of the main functionalities of our project is the Customer searching for goods in his neighborhood on the Map. It's not possible to search using the Map without the Map, but developing a Map API would take more time and resources. We decided to use Google Maps API as it's the most popular Map API allowing to use various functionalities of its own. It's a great API to be included in any startup project which needs a map as the Google provides it for free while the user traffic is not more than 25 000 people. The API provides a full control of the map letting the developers to customize the map with highlighting specific features, adding our own streem views or custom routes on the map. For instance, most of the functionalities we're able to configure in the Google Maps API, we won't be able to do it in the Bing Maps API, where we'd be more isolated with the functionalities. Also, it's also worth mentioning that if we plan adding a mobile version of our project, it wouldn't be much struggle for us as the Google Maps API is also available for mobile devices. Yes, the Bing Maps API can be used for the mobile devices as well, but according to reviews of those two big map APIs, the Bing Maps are more glitchy and unsuitable for our goals. However, we're still not sure about whether the Google Maps API provide Distance Calculator functionality to calculate the most available and closest road distance between a Customer and Seller. In case, it doesn't, then we'll try developing our external Distance Calculator system. The Map system is not the only external system of our project. Our project cannot be present without payments done by Customers to the Vendors for product, or by Vendors to get a subscription. Doing payments in the internet without a bank system is unimaginable. We had a discussion to whether create our own banking simulation functionality or to use what's provided by other projects. At that time we were also suggested about the Paysera banking simulation that can provide us what we need. Thus, after further resolution with the Team, it was decided that we won't have much time developing an external system for bank operation simulation, so we sticked with the idea of using Paysera. Finally, the last external system we need in our project is the ads. Why? We understand that ads are one of the main problems of bad experience with any project, but we're not going to earn much from our project if we don't find any other opportunities. Our goal, is to use create as user-friendly as possible even with the ads, so we'll be adding in those website pages, where we're sure we won't negatively affect to the experience of using our website. As with the other external systems, we decided not developing our own as it'd take much time and resources from us. The Google already has the AdWords API dedicated to create ads in projects, but it's currently in the process of being replaced by modern and user-friendly Google Ads API, which is currently in the beta stage. Even though it's in beta, according to reviews from other projects, we decided that the Google Ads API will fit our expectations on configuring ads better than any other.

### 2. Internal devices

The internal part of our system currently consists of three main blocks: Web Browser in our users' device, the Web Server where scripts belong and the Database Server where all user data is present. To access our project, the user needs a Web Browser application which is present on most of the devices. When accessing our website, the client's Web Browser does an HTTP request to our Web Server to access resources in our server. Our Web Server is held on a Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine provided by our University. Our choice for the Web Server fell for the Apache2 as one of the most commonly used HTTP Server used in the Linux operating systems and most familiar to us, as we were already acknowledged with it on one of our lectures in the University. Before that, we were planning to use Windows Server 2012 instead and using IIS web server software. But, due to lack of experience with that software and limited resources by the University, we decided to find an alternative. One of the main scripts in our Web Server is the "Controller.py" control script, that selects and alters the data in our Database accessing it with the TCP/IP protocol. Already having an experience with the PostgreSQL database management system at the University, we decided to use it in our project. Albeit in the Deployment diagram the Database is visualized to be in another machine, currently the database is located in the Web Server machine, but will be relocated to other machine. At this time, we're not 100 % sure what entities will our Database consist of, what attributes and relationships will be, but we were discussing about including user information, which will depend on the user role. We're definetly not going to use one entity to describe both Customer and Vendor information as these roles are going to differ in many aspects (check **1.3** section).

![Deployment Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139296508-a3e3beab-8713-4e21-8b71-9e59615e2419.jpg)

### 3. Main functionalities

If we want users to use the features of our project, we have to earn the interest of them. Our goal is to convince them choosing us instead of our competitors. We endeavour providing the best experience for them, and for that we must present not only a good design of our website, but also a dissimilar functionalities that will achieve their interest. The Use Case matrix represents all-important key features of our project. Each row represents a key functionality, and each column represents a user role. 

![Use Case Matrix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139297258-1c159b51-5653-4137-8f86-12b92e628811.png)


Cells marked in green indicate that for the user the available functionality for the according row and column. Red-coloured cells represent the opposite. Unauthorized user is the most restricted user role and we're not going to mention it alot. With those functionality prohibitions we desire encouraging them to sign up on our website. Although most of the features are limited to them, however, we still allow them to experience our system by using our search bar and viewing Vendor products and information. The main and obvious difference between Customer and Vendor roles is that the first is dedicated to buying and the other to selling. However,for one email accounts, users can still register both Customer and Vendor accounts. Also, it can be found on the diagram that the Vendor role is divided into two sub-roles: with and without a subscription. The subscription fee is not specified yet, but adding the subscription system we are seeking to find alternative paths of earning besides from ads. Currently, the main difference is that we give our subscribed Vendors to sell more items, boost their products for free in search and disable ads. We might add more functionalities for our subscribers in the future. Finally, the Admin role has the access to all key functionalities, including Customers' and Vendors'. They are responsible for checking for bugs and patrolling the website for impolite reviews. Even though, we allow Admins to delete reviews, it's important that this functionality could be used only in urgent needs as opinion of each Customer is respected. For that reason, the only limitation for the Admins is to edit user reviews as the opinion must be let changed only by the Customer himself.

![UseCase Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139298230-1a96653c-0391-40d1-a5de-1ef5b6388f6a.jpg)


In the diagram, we represented all-important key features in more abstract way by visualizing the main functionalities for Customer and Vendor roles. These roles are visualized as the main roles to whom the project is dedicated. Subscription-free sellers are mentioned because we expect there will be fewer sellers who subscribe, so the diagram is more majority-oriented. However, one of the functionalities of the subscription is mentioned as an extension of the subscription purchase function to show that Vendors have an option of subscription. Unauthorized users are not included because they do not have many features available. The Admin role is not included for the opposite reason - it has too many features available. Thus, no functionality stands out. Searching with the Search bar is one of the only functionalities that available for all user roles. Both Customer and Vendor role users can search in our system, but only the first can buy products. The searching can be done either using the Map, either using the Search bar. As it was mentioned earlier, the first is restricted for the Unauthorized users. In the search field, user has to write the product which he searches for, and according that keyword, a search will be done. We haven't decided on the algorithm which will be used for the searching, but we're seeking for the best performant one. If the keyword has a match, then different product options with different costs and Vendors will be resulted to him. Otherwise, the Search bar will output that nothing was found. We're planning adding additional options for the search in the Search bar. For instance, applying filter product color, Vendor city, and etc. Such filters will provide the best possible matches for the user. 

![Search Activity Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139298442-ec571f46-e212-43ef-a90b-b2952b766a5a.png)


We are betting on our searching system as it's one of those functionalities that are available for our Unauthorized users, and depending on how it's implemented, it'll affect to their decision to whether sign up in our website. It'll be accessible from the main page of our website. Even though, in our zero-feature release milestone that option is not provided on the main page as it can be observed on the main page sketch below, we're planning to add the Search bar functionality in the next release. For now, in the zero-feature release the main page consists of our logo, "Home", "Login" and "Registration" buttons. 

![FIRST-SKETCH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139299288-b3d1413d-0e73-4b94-b93b-52bc646b2e55.jpg)


The logo firstly was done in pixel graphics, but after further Team resolution, it was decided that vectorial logo would look better. For that, we used CorelDRAW vector graphics editor. Clicking the "Home" button redirects the user to the main page. If the user clicks the "Login" button, he'll be redirected to login page where be asked to fill the username or email and password in order to log in to the system. If the user is Unauthorized, then he can select to register from the login page, or from the main page by clicking the "Registration" button. 

![SECOND-SKETCH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139299450-65bdaf32-2756-4d27-9074-3819a6eaec03.jpg)


Selecting those buttons, the user will be redirected to the sign-up page, where he'll have an option to choose whether to register as a Seller (Vendor) or as a Customer. 

![THIRD-SKETCH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139300014-6f6b97fa-734b-4d88-852b-d83441d16177.jpg)


The registration form for both roles will be different as their main functionality also differs. We ask our Vendors to provide more information as it's the Customer who's firstly interested about the Vendor and not vice-versa. Information about the phone number and address are sensible. Therefore, we leave those fields to be filled regarding the want of the Vendor. We understand, that filling only the City of residence and not mentioning Address may lead to incorrect distance calculation. But, the Lithuanian city or village sizes are not that big to have a significant impact on the calculation. Especially, when the Customer and Vendor are living in different cities. 

![FOURTH-SKETCH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139299638-765681f3-b569-45cd-8702-b5093e4ae156.jpg)


In the Customer registration window City of residence for the Customer is set to optional as we don't claim as a useful information in the system. However, mentioning this information in the profile would be useful for the Search bar product prioritizing by city or redirecting to Customer's city location when opening the Map when the user location is turned off.

![FIFTH-SKETCH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47245874/139299944-83c1c98e-f16d-41b8-9472-4ee6bb4d0cd6.jpg)


These sketches were done to represent the zero-feature release outlook of our project. The Balsamiq Wireframes as a great UI wireframing tool was used for sketching components, webpages of our website.

### 4. Tools and technologies

Our project is developed by two different teams: Front-End and Back-End. One is responsible for optimizing the user experience and another maintaining the web application. For the Front-End we've been choosing for a long time the framework as we were not sure which to use. Eventually, we decided on Angular.js as most of the team had an experience with that framework and it's easier to learn from scratch than React or other Front-End frameworks. With the Back-End, the situtation is different. At first, we were using Java for the Back-End, but after some testings done, we had many issues with accessing the database. It was taking too much time on working on it, so we moved on Python 3.6 and Django 3.2. The reason for using these is because django framework, bluntly said, takes care of much of the hassle of web development. The framework offers numerous advantages regarding security, helping to avoid many pitfalls. As it was said before, another alternative that has been considered was Java Spring Boot framework but while it also offers security advantages, it is incredibly complicated in comparison to Django framework, which, on the other hand, allows the developer to avoid complications with, for example, using contents of the database. The reason these exact versions have been chosen is because the current psycopg2 (Python adapter to PostgreSQL) implementation is only compatible with python versions below and equal to 3.6, while the latest Django version is only compatible to python 3.6 and above.
